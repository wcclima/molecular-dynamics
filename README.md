# Molecular Dynamics
Repo for the molecular dynamics project.

## 1 - Objective

The goal of this project is to simulate a gas by modelling its molecules as classical particles interacting with each other via the Lennard-Jones potential. The simulation allows us to produce animations depicting the gas molecules's movement, to see the gas achieve its thermal equilibrium, to measure its temperature and to change its temperature to show phase transition.

## 3 - Module architecture

Description of the module `molecular_dynamics` architecture.

- `molecular_dynamics/__init__.py`
  - Initialises the module.
  - Imports the MolecularDynamicsPBC class, with periodic boundary condition (PBC).
  - Imports the MolecularDynamicsBHW class, with bottom hard wall boundary condition (BHW).

- `molecular_dynamics/molecular_dynamics_pbc.py`: defines the MolecularDynamicsPBC class with the methods
  -  `display_parameters`
  -  `generate_initial_conditions`, requires functions from `_initial_cond.py`; 
  -  `plot_initial_conditions`, requires functions from `_plot_methods.py`;
  -  `plot_initial_forces`, requires functions from `_plot_methods.py`;
  -  `generates_dynamics`, requires functions from `_n_body_dynamics.py`;
  -  `generate_gas_animation`, requires functions from `_animation_methods.py`;
  -  `generate_velocity_distribution`, requires functions from `_stats_methods.py`;
  -  `generate_velocity_distribution_animation`, requires functions from `_animation_methods.py`;
  -  `measure_kT`, requires functions from `_stats_methods.py`;
  -  `change_temperature`, requires functions from `_thermostat.py`.
- `molecular_dynamics/molecular_dynamics_bhw.py`: defines the MolecularDynamicsBHW class with the same methods as above.
- `molecular_dynamics/_animation_func.py`: functions producing the animations of the gas moviment and the velocity histogram, used in the `generate_gas_animation` and `generate_velocity_distribution_animation` methods.
- `molecular_dynamics/_compute_forces_func.py`: functions computing the molecules pairwise total forces and the bottom hard wall forces, used in the `plot_initial_forces` method and in `_n_body_dynamics.py` functions.
- `molecular_dynamics/_initial_cond_func.py`: function generating the molecules's initial conditions, used in the `generate_initial_conditions` method. 
- `molecular_dynamics/_n_body_dynamics_func.py`: functions generating the gas dynamics, used in the `generates_dynamics` and `change_temperature` methods.
- `molecular_dynamics/_plot_func.py`: functions generating the plots, used in the `plot_initial_conditions` and `plot_initial_forces` methods.
- `molecular_dynamics/_stats_func.py`: functions implementing the temperature measurement by generating the velocity distribution and fitting it with the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution or using the equipartition theorem, used in the `measure_kT` and `generate_velocity_distribution` methods.
- `molecular_dynamics/_thermostat_func.py`: functions that instantaneously change the molecules's velocities, thus changing the gas temperature after interation, used in the `change_temperature` method.

- Animation of a gas of density $\rho = 0.25$ in a box with side $L = 20$ and initial velocity with $\langle v^2_x\rangle = \langle v^2_y\rangle = 100$. PBCs, time step $\Delta t = 0.005$ and $50000$ total time steps were assumed.

- Animation velocity modulus distribution of the above gas. The distribution is averaged over time to mitigate statistical fluctuations. The gas temperature at the equilibrium is $kT = 1.25$.
