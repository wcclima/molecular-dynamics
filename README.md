# Molecular Dynamics
Repo for the molecular dynamics project.

## 1 - Objective

The goal of this project is to simulate a gas by modelling its molecules as classical particles interacting with each other via the Lennard-Jones potential. The simulation allows us to produce animations depicting the gas molecules's movement, to see the gas achieve its thermal equilibrium, to measure its temperature and to change its temperature to show phase transition.

## 3 - Module architecture

Description of the module `molecular_dynamics` architecture.

  -  `display_parameters`
  -  `generate_initial_conditions`, requires functions from `_initial_cond.py`;

- `molecular_dynamics/_plot_func.py`: functions generating the plots, used in the `plot_initial_conditions` and `plot_initial_forces` methods.
- `molecular_dynamics/_stats_func.py`: functions implementing the temperature measurement by generating the velocity distribution and fitting it with the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution or using the equipartition theorem, used in the `measure_kT` and `generate_velocity_distribution` methods.
- `molecular_dynamics/_thermostat_func.py`: functions that instantaneously change the molecules's velocities, thus changing the gas temperature after interation, used in the `change_temperature` method.
- `molecular_dynamics/_pression_func.py`: function that measures the pressure exerted by the molecules over an imaginary perfectly reflective hard wall in the PBC case, used in the `measure_pressure` method of the `MolecularDynamicsPBC` class.

## 4 - Features

- The `Molecular_DynamicsPBC` class:
  - generates a bi-dimensional gas with periodic boundary conditions on the x- and y-directions;
  - it accepts one or two molecule species, with the mass and size of the second species scaled with respect to the first species;
  - the second species can be used to visualise the Brownian motion.
  - It has the following methods:
    - `display_parameters`: prints all the relevant parameters for the model initialisation;
    - `generate_initial_conditions`, generates the gas initial state in a squared lattice or at random positions and with Gaussian dstributed x- and y-velocity components with variance defined by the `initial_temperature` parameter;
    - `plot_initial_conditions`, plots the initial positions and velocity vectors of the gas molecules;
    - `plot_initial_force`, plots the initial positions and total force vectors of the gas molecules;
    - `generates_dynamics`, generates the gas dynamics for a number of steps defined by the `total_time_steps` parameter;
    - `generate_gas_animation`, animates the gas positions over the course of its evolution and saves it as an `.mp4` file;
    - `generate_velocity_distribution`, generates the molecules's velocity modulus distribution averaged over time to mitigate statistical fluctuations;
    - `generate_velocity_distribution_animation`, animates the molecules velocity distribution averaged over time;
    - `measure_kT`, allows three different methods to measure the gas temperature,
      - `instantaneous fitting`, which fits the velocity distribution at the final time step with the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution,
      - `averaged_fitting`, which fits the time averaged velocity distribution at the final time step with the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution,
      - `equipartition`, which computes the average kinetic energy and used the equipartition theorem to determine the temperature;
    - `measure_pressure`, which computes the pressure of the gas and plots its profile over time;
    - `change_temperature`, changes the gas temperature by rescaling the velocity at the current final time step, generating a new dynamics from there and them concatenating the result with the gas past history.

- The `Molecular_DynamicsBHW` class:
  - generates a bi-dimensional gas with periodic boundary conditions on the x-direction and a bottom hard wall and an open top end in the y-direction;
  - it accepts one or two molecule species, with the mass and size of the second species scaled with respect to the first species;
  - it allows for gravitational acceleration.
  - It has the same methods as the `Molecular_DynamicsPBC` class, except for the `measure_pressure` method.
